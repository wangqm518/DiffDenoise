# DiffDenoise
Existing denoising methods require paired clean and noisy images for training, i.e., they are supervised. However, in reality, it is difficult to obtain clean images corresponding to noisy ones. For additive Gaussian noise, it aligns perfectly with diffusion models, as they are inherently noise predictors.
